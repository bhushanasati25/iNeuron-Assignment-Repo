    "Use floats when convenience and speed matter. A float gives you an approximation of the number you declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use decimals when precision matters. Decimals can suffer from their own precision issues, but generally, decimals are more precise than floats. The performance difference between float and decimal, with Python 3, is not outlandish, and in my experience, the precision benefits of a decimal outweigh the performance benefits of a float.\n"
