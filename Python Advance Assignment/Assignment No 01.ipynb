    "Q1 What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :- Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "* It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "* The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "* It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "* It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",
    "* Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "* Multiple instances of an object can be made."

    "\n",
    "* Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "* Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this doesnot happens.\n",
    "* A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",
    "* As Classes have no allocated memory. they can't be manipulated. but objects can be manipulated."
