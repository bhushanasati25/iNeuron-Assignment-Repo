    "\n",
    "Solution :- A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions. In Python and newer versions of python, all functions in the class are by default bound methods."

That is, this feature is mostly intended to avoid namespace collisions in instances, not to restrict access to names in general."
