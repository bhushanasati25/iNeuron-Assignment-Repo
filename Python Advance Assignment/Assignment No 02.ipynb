Changing the behavior of operator is as simple as changing the behavior of method or function. You define methods in your class and operators work according to that behavior defined in methods. When we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined. There by changing this magic methodâ€™s code, we can give extra meaning to the + operator.\n",
